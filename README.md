**Description of Data Asset:** 
- The Canadian Wind Turbine Database contains the geographic location and key technology details for wind turbines installed in Canada.
- This dataset was jointly compiled by researchers at CanmetENERGY-Ottawa and by the Centre for Applied Business Research in Energy and the Environment at the University of Alberta, under contract from Natural Resources Canada.
- Note that total project capacity was sourced from publicly available information, and may not match the sum of individual turbine rated capacity due to de-rating and other factors. The turbine numbering scheme adopted for this database is not intended to match the developerâ€™s asset numbering.
- This database will be updated in the future. If you are aware of any errors, and would like to provide additional information, or for general inquiries, please use the contact email address listed on this page.
